# Markdown Previewer

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/massivemike8/pen/abdwoZr](https://codepen.io/massivemike8/pen/abdwoZr).

The markdown previewer allows you to enter markdown into one section of the page and view the results in the other.

### Why the project is useful
The key aspects of the markdown previewer are dangerouslySetInnerHTML, which acts as a replacement for innerHTML in React, and the marked.js library, necessary for the conversion of markdown.

### How you can get started with the project
freeCodeCamp offers great resources which helped me get started, and the markdown previewer forms one of the neccessary projects to complete in the Front End Libraries.
